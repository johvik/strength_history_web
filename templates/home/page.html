    <p>Strength History is a tool that keep track of your strength training data.</p>
    <p>It was initially an <a href="https://github.com/johvik/strength_history">Android application</a>, but a web site with a public API has evolved as time passed. The entire project is developed during my spare time and is open source.</p>
